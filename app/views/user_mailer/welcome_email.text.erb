-- Hey <%= @user.name %>! -- 

Thanks for letting me help you track your time.  Together, we'll make time tracking easy and, dare I say, fun?  
Ok, at very least, painless. Try it for a few days and let me know.*

How it works:

At the end of the day, I'll send you an email.  When you finish your day's tasks, send a quick 
reply in this format:
@Project #hrs description

For example,
@project1 #3 completed a bunch of sales calls
@project2 #4.5 implemented the enhanced security feature

And that's it!

We'll process everything behind the scenes.  If you need to review your entries, 
go to <%= @url %>.  You can add, modify, delete, and review all your entries and projects there.

See you this afternoon!

*To send feedback, just reply to any of my emails with "FEEDBACK" as the subject.
